Create TypeScript code following SOLID principles. Use MVVM architecture with dumb models that only contain properties,
view models for business logic, and services for data operations. Keep models, views, view models, and services in
separate layers with clear interfaces.

Very important: attempt to keep your code as simple as possible.

In general focus on getting working uint tests before creating User Interfaces.
